## Automate-Terminal

**Automate-Terminal** is a DevOps automation toolkit built to simplify various operations, such as health checks, live monitoring, and automatic deployments. The project provides essential tools to manage server health, disk usage, deployment automation, and more, all through simple scripts.

---

### üìù **Features**

* **Service Health Checks**: Automatically check the health status of your services.
* **Watch Mode (Live Monitoring)**: Continuously monitor system performance and service uptime.
* **Disk Usage Alerts**: Get notified when your disk usage exceeds a defined threshold.
* **Auto Deployment**: Deploy code to a remote server via SSH or Git with ease.
* **Logging**: Keep track of your operations with logs and timestamps.

---

### üì¶ **Requirements**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

* **Docker** (for containerization)
* **Docker Compose** (for managing multi-container setups)
* **Git** (for version control)

---

### üöÄ **Installation**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/05sanjaykumar/Automate-Terminal.git
   cd Automate-Terminal
   ```

2. Build and run the project using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will build the Docker container and start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How to Use**

Once the Docker container is up and running, you can interact with it directly from the terminal. Here are some of the key operations:

1. **Health Check Script**: To run a health check for a specific service, execute:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it devops-wizard ./scripts/health_check.sh <SERVICE_URL>
   ```

   Example for checking a website:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it devops-wizard ./scripts/health_check.sh https://www.example.com
   ```

2. **Deployment Script**: Deploy your code to a remote server:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it devops-wizard ./scripts/deploy.sh <LOCAL_PATH> <USER@HOST> <REMOTE_PATH>
   ```

3. **Disk Usage Alerts**: To check disk usage, use the following:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it devops-wizard ./scripts/disk_check.sh
   ```

4. **Log Files**: View logs to track health checks and other operations:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it devops-wizard tail -f /app/logs/health_check.log
   ```
